Basic CSS: Use CSS Variables to change several elements at once
CSS Variables are a powerful way to change many CSS style properties at once by changing only one value.

Follow the instructions below to see how changing just three values can change the styling of many elements.


In the penguin class, change the black value to gray, the gray value to white, and the yellow value to orange.

penguin class should declare the --penguin-skin variable and assign it to gray.
penguin class should declare the --penguin-belly variable and assign it to white.
penguin class should declare the --penguin-beak variable and assign it to orange.
