Applied Visual Design: Adjust the Height of an Element Using the height Property
You can specify the height of an element using the height property in CSS, similar to the width property. Here's an example that changes the height of an image to 20px:

img {
  height: 20px;
}

Add a height property to the h4 tag and set it to 25px.

Your code should change the h4 height property to a value of 25 pixels.
