Basic HTML and HTML5: Nest Many Elements within a Single div Element
The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.

The div element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all.

Just like any other non-self-closing element, you can open a div element with <div> and close it on another line with </div>.


Nest your "Things cats love" and "Things cats hate" lists all within a single div element.

Hint: Try putting your opening div tag above your "Things cats love" p element and your closing div tag after your closing ol tag so that both of your lists are within one div.

Nest your p elements inside your div element.
Nest your ul element inside your div element.
Nest your ol element inside your div element.
Make sure your div element has a closing tag.
