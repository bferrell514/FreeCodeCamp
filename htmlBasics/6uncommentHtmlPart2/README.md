Basic HTML and HTML5: Comment out HTML
Remember that in order to start a comment, you need to use <!-- and to end a comment, you need to use -->

Here you'll need to end the comment before your h2 element begins.


Comment out your h1 element and your p element, but not your h2 element

Comment out your h1 element so that it is not visible on your page.
Leave your h2 element uncommented so that it is visible on your page.
Comment out your p element so that it is not visible on your page.
Be sure to close each of your comments with -->.
Do not change the order of the h1 h2 or p in the code.
