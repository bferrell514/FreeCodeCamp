Unordered List
HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point style lists.

Unordered lists start with an opening <ul> element, followed by any number of <li> elements. Finally, unordered lists close with a </ul>

For example:

<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
would create a bullet point style list of "milk" and "cheese".


Remove the last two p elements and create an unordered list of three things that cats love at the bottom of the page.

Create a ul element.
You should have three li elements within your ul element.
Make sure your ul element has a closing tag.
Make sure your li elements have closing tags.
