Basic HTML and HTML5: Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field
Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputted anything.

You can create placeholder text like so:

<input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">


Set the placeholder value of your text input to "cat photo URL".

Add a placeholder attribute to the existing text input element.
Set the value of your placeholder attribute to "cat photo URL".
The finished input element should have valid syntax.
