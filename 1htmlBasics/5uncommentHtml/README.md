Basic HTML and HTML5: Uncomment HTML
Commenting is a way that you can leave comments for other developers within your code without affecting the resulting output that is displayed to the end user.

Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

Comments in HTML starts with <!--, and ends with a -->


Uncomment your h1, h2 and p elements.

Make your h1 element visible on your page by uncommenting it.
Make your h2 element visible on your page by uncommenting it.
Make your p element visible on your page by uncommenting it.
Be sure to delete all trailing comment tags, i.e. -->.
