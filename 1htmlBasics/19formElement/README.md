Basic HTML and HTML5: Create a Form Element
You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action on your form element.

For example:

<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>


Nest your text field inside a form element, and add the action="/submit-cat-photo" attribute to the form element.

Nest your text input element within a form element.
Make sure your form has an action attribute which is set to /submit-cat-photo
Make sure your form element has well-formed open and close tags.
